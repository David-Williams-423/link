# Inspiration

The inspiration behind "Link" came from our experiences navigating through crowded or confusing areas and struggling to find friends or family members among the crowd. We envisioned a solution that could leverage Ultra Wideband (UWB) technology to provide precise tracking and location information. Our goal was to create an app that could seamlessly connect people in various scenarios, making it easier for them to find each other, whether at large events, transportation hubs, or in emergency situations.

## What it does

"Link" is an iOS app designed to help you find people in challenging environments. It utilizes the power of Ultra Wideband (UWB) chip technology to accurately track the direction and distance of other app users. With "Link," you can:

- **Pinpoint Locations:** Easily locate the exact position of your friends or family members, even in the midst of a crowded concert, a bustling airport, or a chaotic theme park.
- **Ensure Safety:** In emergency situations, quickly locate and connect with loved ones, ensuring everyone's safety and peace of mind.

## How we built it

Building "Link" was a complicated, but rewarding journey. We leveraged the following technologies and methods:

- **Ultra Wideband (UWB) Technology:** We harnessed the power of UWB chips to provide the highest level of precision in location tracking.
- **SwiftUI:** Our frontend was exclusively developed with SwiftUI, ensuring a modern and responsive user interface.
- **Firebase for the Backend:** Firebase was our choice for the backend to handle user data and authentication.
- **Apple's Nearby Interaction and Multiplier Connectivity APIs:** We used these Apple APIs to establish links between devices, enabling seamless communication between users.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** We focused on creating an easy-to-use interface, allowing users to add friends and track their location.

## Challenges we ran into

We had many issues with GitHub and merge conflicts and learning how to use the UWB technology.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are very proud of the FireBase database that we made from scratch and the UI animation that we put a lot of time and thought into.

## What we learned

We learned a lot about coding together in a time crunch. We had to decide what the priorities were and we had to be able to delegate and work together well.

## What's next for Link

In the future, we plan to expand the capabilities of "Link" by:

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** We're exploring options to bring "Link" to Android devices, ensuring a wider user base can benefit from our technology.
- **Integration with Wearable Devices:** We're working on integrating "Link" with wearable devices to provide a seamless and convenient tracking experience.

"Link" is just the beginning of our journey to use technology for human connections and safety, and we're excited to see how it will evolve and improve in the coming months and years as we continue to improve on it.
